### What is CDN?
- a CDN is a network of servers distributed globally to deliver web content and services quickly to users based on their geographic location
- goal: speed up delivery of website resources and content by reducing distance data must travel 
- data will be sent to these CDN servers that will be an intermediary 

#### why use CDN?
- reduced latency - serve data closer to user
- improved user experience - faster access
- reduced server load - distributes traffic across servers
- increased availability and redundancy 

#### basic workflow
- request redirection
	- user request content and CDN directs the request to closest available server 
- caching
	- cache content such as images and videos to reduce data fetched from origin server
- real time updates
	- can update cached content in real time as updates 

#### types of content delivered by CDNs 
- static content
	- images, style sheets, JS, videos 
- dynamic content
	- deliver personalized or interact content 
- APIs and security updates
	- CDNs can handle API requests and provide security layers 

#### real world applications
- video streaming
- e-commerce
- corporate websites

### Centralized logging
#### what are logs?
- a file that lists actions that have occured
- with log file analysis tools, you can get a good idea where visitors are from, how often the come, etc. 

#### who creates logs?
- Os
- browsers
- load balancer
- database
- web server
- application servers
- most OS store logs for user actions and events
	- e.g. windows logs
-  all heavy software from professional vendors create logs 

#### server logs
- server log is a log file (or several) automatically created and maintained by a server consisting of a list of activities it performed
- these are not usually accessible for general internet users
	- only admin or web masters
- log data often grouped into different files based on log type 

#### what are log levels?
- info
- debug
- warning
- error
- fatal

#### log server
-  log server is a centralized system that collects, stores, and manages log data generated by various sources within a network or application environment
	- can include servers, network devices, applications, security systems, etc.
- primary purpose is to provide consolidated and organized log info for monitoring, analysis, troubleshooting, security 
- log collection
	- devices and system generate log data as they run
	- system events, errors, warning, etc.
- log forwarding
	- log data is forwarded to the centralized log server
	- various protocols like syslog, SNMP traps, custom API
- storage
	- stores the received log data in a structured and searchable format
	- might involve databases, file systems
- indexing and searching
	- makes log data easily searchable and accessible
- analysis and monitoring 
	- provide tools and interface to analyze log data
