#### General
- **Information System** - five major components: hardware, software, data, people, and processes. 
	- information systems is to take data and turn it into information, and then transform that information into organizational knowledge
	- These components collect, store, organize, and distribute data throughout the organization
- **SDLC Systems/software Development Life Cycle** - a structured and risk averse approach to system/software development designed to manage larger projects. 
	- similar to an assembly line and cannot have design changes once further in
	- structured approach to analyzing, designing, building, and implementing information systems in an organization
- **business analysis** - practice of enabling change in an org by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholder
- **business case** - document or presentation that outlines the justification for initiating a project or undertaking a particular business initiative
- **data** - raw facts and figures; **information** is data that has been processed to be meaningful
- **ERP Enterprise Resource Planning** - software can integrate all of the processes needed to run a company
- **CRM Customer Relationship Management** - principles, practices, and guidelines an organization follows when interacting with its customers. often used to refer to systems to help manage external interactions with customers
- **revenue (top line)** - money earned from selling products and/or services vs **profit (bottom line)** - money left after subtracting expenses from revenue
- **asset** - Capital assets are assets that are used in a company's business operations to generate revenue over the course of more than one year. information systems are an asset
- **investment** - an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation
- **operations** - functions of business directly related to providing its good/services to the market 
- **TCO Total Cost of Ownership** - purchase price of an asset plus the cost of operation
- **ROI Return on Investment** - evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment
- - **CBA Cost Benefit Analysis** - process to measure the benefits of a decision or taking action minus the costs associated with taking that action.
	- sums the potential rewards expected from a situation or action and then subtracts the total costs associated
- **OPEX Operating Expense** - expenses through normal operations like rent, equipment, inventory, etc.
- **CAPEX Capital Expense** - purchases as investment
- **cost centre** - department or function in an org that does not directly add to profit but costs money to operate e.g. HR or IT
- **sunk cost** - money already spent and cannot be recovered
---
#### Requirements 
- **requirements** - what a business needs from its information system.
	- functional - the what; specific features
	- **non-functional**  the how; performance or quality attributes and characteristics  
- **scalability** - system's ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changing demands 
- **accessibility** - accommodating ability for use of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability type or severity of impairment
- **FURPS**
	- **functionality** - specific functions or features of the software
	- **usability** (non functional) - UX, responsiveness, aesthetics
	- **reliability** (non functional) - availability, failure recovery, accuracy 
	- **performance** (non functional) - speed, efficiency, resource consumption
	- **supportability** (non functional) - serviceability, maintainability, adaptability 
---
#### Implementation
- **Implementation methodologies**
	- **direct cutover** - terminate old system and start new one; low cost high risk
	- **parallel operation** - new and legacy system running at same time; low risk high cost
	- **pilot operation** - new system given to small number of users before everyone else; lower risk, lower cost than parallel
	- **phased operation** - parts of the system to go live gradually; lower risk high cost
- **Implementation tasks** - data conversion, training, documentation, maintenance
---
#### Projects
- **project** - an activity with a discrete beginning, discrete end, and produced a unique product 
- **scope** - work required to output a project's deliverable. boundaries, goals, deliverables, objectives
- **scope creep** - continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project's scope. 
	- can happen when project scope is not properly defined, documented, or controlled
- **critical path** - chain of tasks that must be completed for a project to finish in shortest time
	- if they are delayed, the whole project completion is delayed
- **iron triangle** - budget, scope, time
	- maintain balance; in all projects
- **quality triangle** - cost, time, quality. only 2 of 3 can be optimized 
- **agile/iterative** - methodology that emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and incremental progress
- **linear** - the steps are interdependent on each other where you have to finish one step before going onto the next 
	- they are rigid because you can't to back to make changes based on feedback once you've moved onto the next phase
- **agile** - utilize incremental changes. 
	- Each **increment** is released in a specified period of time (called a time box), creating a regular release schedule with very specific objectives.
	- iterative development, user interaction/feedback, and flexibility to change
- **scrum** - employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. 
	- flexible and adaptable by breaking the project into small chunks called sprints. 
	- deliver a shippable product increment at end of each sprint
- **waterfall** - methodology that describes having specific discrete steps in a sequential order
	- must complete step before the next can begin
	- can't go back to make changes based on feedback
	- task dependency 
- **backlog** - a prioritized list of tasks to be completed 
- **incremental** - product designed and tested in small manageable parts
	- building on previous versions
- increment - sum of all product backlogs completed during a sprint
- **iteration**  (sprint) - a fixed time period for a specific set of work to be completed; typically 2 weeks but can be longer
- **timebox** - activity given a fixed amount of time to be completed. e.g. sprints in scrum
- **production** - something it "in production" when it is live and being used by people
