### The Productivity Paradox
- original study found that IT had not improved productivity
- phenomenon called the "productivity paradox"
- Although it is too early to conclude that IT’s productivity contribution has been subpar, a paradox remains in our inability to unequivocally document any contribution after so much effort.
- The various explanations that have been proposed can be grouped into four categories:
	- **1) Mismeasurement** of outputs and inputs
	- **2)** **Lags** due to learning and adjustment
	- **3)** **Redistribution** and dissipation of profits
	- **4)** **Mismanagement** of information and technology
- returning to the study later, and found that IT did, indeed, provide a positive result for businesses
	-  true advantages in using technology were not directly relatable to higher productivity, but to “softer” measures, such as the impact on organizational structure
	- They also found that the impact of information technology can vary widely between companies

### IT Doesn't Matter
- In 2003, Nicholas Carr published an article titled "IT Doesn’t Matter" in the _Harvard Business Review_, where he argued that as information technology became widespread, it lost its ability to differentiate businesses and had become a commodity.
- He likened IT to other commodities, where price and availability are the primary factors in choosing a provider
- Carr suggested IT should be managed more like a utility, focused on minimizing costs and downtime as he saw no competitive advantage from IT itself
- his article lead to widespread debate and prompted important discussion for IT's role in business strategy and competitive advantage

### Competitive Advantage 
- a company is said to have competitive advantage over its rivals when it is able to distain profits that exceed the average for the industry 
- two primary methods for obtaining competitive advantage
	- **cost advantage**
	- **differentiation advantage**
- how does IT be a factor for one or both of these?
	- we answer using the **value chain** and **five force models** 

### The Value Chain
- ![[Pasted image 20240916191009.png]]
- value is built through the valie chain
	- a series of activities undertaken by the company to produce a product or service
- each step in the value chain may not be perfect for every type of company
- value chain is made up of two sets of activities
	- **primary activities** and **support activities** 
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Primary activities</mark> are functions that directly impact the creation of a product or service 
	- the goal of a primary activity is to add value that is greater than the cost of the activity 
	- **inbound logistics** - processes that bring in raw materials and other needed inputs
		- IT can be used to make these process more efficient like with supply chain management systems
	- **operations** - any part of business that converts the raw materials into a final product or service is part of operations
		- IT can be used to provide more efficient processes and increase innovation through flows of info 
	- **outbound logistics** - functions required to get the product out to the customer
		- IT can be used to improve processes or be the delivery method itself
	- **sales/marketing** - functions that will entice buyers to purchase the products are part of sales and marketing 
		- IT can be used to innovate product design and reach customers
	- **service** - functions a business performs after the product has been purchased to maintain and enhance the product's value
		- can be enhanced via technology as well
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Support Activities</mark> are functions in an org that support all of the primary activities
	- can be considered indirect costs to the org 
	- **firm infrastructure** - infrastructure includes finance, accounting, ERP systems, and quality control
		- all depend on IT and represent areas where IT can have positive effects
	- **human resource management** - consists of recruiting, hiring, and other services needed to attract and retain employees
		- IT allows employees to use technology for a more flexible work environment 
	- **technology development** - provides innovation that supports primary activities 
		- IT is the primary generator of value in this support activity
	- **Procurement** 
		- focuses on the acquisition of raw materials used in the creation of products 

### Porter's Five Forces Model
![[Pasted image 20240916195504.png]]
- This model can be used to help understand the degree of competition in an industry and analyze its strengths and weaknesses
- **Threat of substitute products or services** - this first force challenges the user to consider the likelihood of another product or service replace the product or service your offer 
	- the more there are, the less profitability there will be 
	- substitution refers to a product being replaced by a similar product for the purpose of accomplishing the same task. It does not mean dissimilar products or services such as flying to a destination rather than traveling by rail
- **bargaining power of suppliers** - a supplier's bargaining power is strong when there are few suppliers from which your company can obtain a needed product or service
	- there where are a lot of suppliers, their bargaining power is lower 
- **bargaining power of customers** - customer's bargaining power is strong when your company along with your competitors is attempting to provide the same product to tis customers
- **barriers to entry** - The easier it is to enter an industry, the more challenging it will be to make a profit in that industry
- **rivalry among existing competitors** - When rivalry is fierce, each competitor is attempting to gain additional market share from the others. This can result in aggressive pricing, increasing customer support, or other factors which might lure a customer away from a competitor

### Using Information Systems for Competitive Advantage
- A strategic information system is designed specifically to implement an organizational strategy meant to provide a competitive advantage
- A strategic information system attempts to do one or more of the following:
	- Deliver a product or a service at a lower cost;
	- Deliver a product or service that is differentiated;
	- Help an organization focus on a specific market segment;
	- Enable innovation.
