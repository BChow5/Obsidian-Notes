### Defining Information Systems

- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Information System</mark> can be defined as a set of interrelated components that collect, process, store, and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization 
- Information systems are a combination of hardware, software, and telecommunications networks that people build and use to collect, create, and distribute useful data 
- Information systems are interrelated components working together to collect, process, store, and disseminate information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization in an organization

### Components of Information Systems

- Information systems can be viewed as having five major components:
	- hardware
	- software
	- data
	- people
	- processes

##### Hardware
- the physical, tangible, parts of an information system
- e.g. computers and keyboards

##### Software
- the intangible set of instructions (programs) that tell hardware what to do
- two main categories of software are:
	- operating systems 
		- interface between the hardware and the Application software
	- application software
		- allows the user to perform tasks

##### Data
- Facts and information used by organizations for decision-making, which becomes powerful when organized in databases
- the analysis of data i used to improve the organization's performance 

##### Network Communication 
- suggested component to be added: communication 
- an information system can exist without communication but in today's hyper connected world, it is extremely rare to not be connected to a network
- Technically, the networking communication component is made up of hardware and software, but it is such a core feature of today’s information systems that it has become its own category

##### People
- the users and professionals managing the system
	- from support staff to CEO 
- people involved in the Information Systems are an essential element 

##### Process
- the series of steps aimed at achieving goals, integrating technology to enhance productivity and competitive advantage 

### The role of Information Systems

- Information systems are composed of both tangible and intangible components that collect, organize, and distribute data, transforming it into valuable organizational knowledge 
- **Mainframe Era (1950s-1960s)**: Large, room-sized computers were used for data processing and scientific calculations, affordable only to big organizations.
- **PC Revolution (1970s-1980s)**: Personal computers became widely available with the rise of companies like Apple and IBM, bringing computing power to small businesses.
- **Client-Server Architecture (1980s)**: Businesses began networking computers to share resources and data, leading to the development of ERP systems to streamline operations.
- **The Internet and World Wide Web (1990s)**: The Internet evolved from a research network to a commercial platform, with companies like Amazon and eBay revolutionizing e-commerce.
- **Web 2.0 (2000s)**: The Internet became more interactive, allowing for blogging, social networking, and online business models, reshaping industries like retail and media.

### Can Information System bring Competitive Advantage?

- The assumption has long been that implementing information systems will give businesses a competitive advantage, improving processes and efficiency. 
- However, in 2003, Nicholas Carr challenged this view in his article "I.T. Doesn’t Matter," 
	- arguing that information technology had become a commodity, similar to electricity, and should be managed to reduce costs and risks rather than viewed as a unique advantage.
