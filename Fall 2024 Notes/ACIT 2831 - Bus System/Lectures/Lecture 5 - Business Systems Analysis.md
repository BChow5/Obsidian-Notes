### What is a project
- a project is an activity with
	- a discrete beginning
	- a discrete end
	- which produces a unique product 

#### Project terms
- project scope
	- the boundaries, goals, deliverables, and objectives of a project
	- outlines what the project will achieve and what is included in the work required to deliver those outcomes
- project iron triangle
	- three project constraints
		- scope
		- time
		- cost
	- need to maintain "balance"
	- if one constraint is modified, you would want to adjust the other 2 constraints accordingly to balance  
	- modified necessarily 
- scope creep
	- uncontrolled expansion or changes in a project's scope, often without corresponding increases in time, budget, or resources
	- could be from bad communication, unclear initial project scope, stakeholder requests
	- very likely, especially in complex projects 
	- strain on resources 
- project critical path
	- chain of tasks that affect the project finish date 
	- if one task on the critical path is late, it will cause the whole project to be late
	- dependencies 
		- tasks that need to be completed before another can start 
	- able to identify the most critical tasks that will take the most time

### Linear Projects
- waterfall method
- SDLC
- usually very rigid
- can't go back to make changes much
### Agile terms
- increment
	- one small functional piece of a project towards the final project
	- building on previous versions 
- timebox
	- fixed period of time allocated for a task
	- set at project outset 
	- if you reach the end of the allocated time, then you just stop working on it
		- incomplete work is stopped 
- iteration
	- process of repeating operations or steps to achieve a desired outcome 
	- duration: 1-4 weeks
	- sprints
- backlog
