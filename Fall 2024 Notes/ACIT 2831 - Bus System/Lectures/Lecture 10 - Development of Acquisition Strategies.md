### buying vs making an LMS
#### making
- coding programmers, designers, analysts
- server, database
- customizability 
- security
- scalability costs more 
	- TCO
- time sink 
- 

#### Buying an LMS
- research into what we need from the LMS
- search for LMS that meet those needs
- less time but maybe more money 

### Terms 
- on premise (on prem)
	- located on our facility and we have control of it 
- co-location
	- places our stuff in someone else's data center 
- public cloud
	- service and infrastructure are hosted off site by a 3rd part provider and shared across multiple clients or organizations 
- private cloud
	- dedicated cloud environment to a single organization that can be hosted on premises or by a 3rd party provider
- hybrid cloud
	- combined of the public and private cloud 
	- able to scale starting with your private cloud and add more capability to it with the public cloud 
- SaaS
	- software as a service
	- cloud based apps for users 
- PaaS
	- platform as a service
	- provides developers a framework and tools to build apps or software
	- e.g. AWS sells virtual servers 
- IaaS
	- Infrastructure as a service 
	- access to resources like cloud, software, etc.
	- businesses can rent IT infrastructure such as servers, storage, networking, and virtualization from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than having to invest in and maintain physical hardware on-premises.
- configuration
	- changing work flows an other things through settings
-  customization
	- changing through code (making it)
- in-house
	- making it yourself; in your own organization
- differentiation (strategy)
	- method businesses use to change their product to be more unique
	- things we do in our company that our competitors can't do/can't replicate 

### System Acquisition strategies

#### make
-  when an org has custom or strategic (non) functional requirements
	- something they cant or wont get from a 3rd party
- more expensive to implement and maintain and requires the organization to have system development and maintenance capabilities inhouse
- more TCO 

#### Buy
- standard functionality (everyone gets mostly the same thing)
- often with built-in integrations (Microsoft 365)
- lower acquisition costs
- faster to deploy and can be less expensive to maintain than inhouse
- harder and more expensive to upgrade and migrate 

#### Rent
- cloud subscription model and outsourcing of IT and dev capability
- standard functionality across all tenants
- can be expensive and harder to customize but potentially lower TCO and advanced capabilities, like AI, elastic scalability, and cyber security 
- important - no custody of data
