### Review Terms

#### projects
- project definition
	- a project is an activity with
		- a discrete beginning
		- a discrete end
		- which produces a unique product 
- project scope
	- the boundaries, goals, deliverables, and objectives of a project
	- outlines what the project will achieve and what is included in the work required to deliver those outcomes
- iron triangle
	- three project constraints
		- scope
		- time
		- cost
	- need to maintain "balance"
	- if one constraint is modified, you need to adjust the other 2 constraints accordingly to balance  
- scope creep
	- uncontrolled expansion or changes in a project's scope, often without corresponding increases in time, budget, or resources
	- could be from bad communication, unclear initial project scope, stakeholder requests
	- very likely, especially in complex projects 
	- strain on resources 
- critical path
	- chain of tasks that affect the project finish date 
	- if one task on the critical path is late, it will cause the whole project to be late
	- has dependencies 
		- tasks that need to be completed before another can start 
	- able to identify the most critical tasks that will take the most time
	- cannot be delayed without affecting the project end date 
	- these tasks will determine the end date 
#### "traditional"
- task dependency
	- represents the order that tasks need to be performed
	- a task needs to be completed before you can go to the next task 
- waterfall
	- methodology that describes having specific discrete steps in a sequential order
	- very difficult to go back a step because of the task dependencies 
- linear 
	- could also be described like waterfall
	- when tasks are done in a specific sequential order 

#### agile
- - scrum
	- framework based on agile method to help with teamwork
	- uses sprints that are an iterative period where teams work on tasks 
- increment
	- sum of all product backlogs completed during a sprint 
	- increments are dependent
		- task 1 needs to be done before task 2 
- iteration/iterative
	- process of repeating a set of steps or instructions
	- iterative means just doing things in iteration
	- we get an increment at the end of each iteration 
	- still a linear process because increments are task dependent 
- timebox
	- give an activity a fixed amount of time to complete 
	- we timebox our sprints in agile 
- backlog
	- prioritized list of tasks or items that need to be completed
	- high priority items to be completed first 
	- like the scope
