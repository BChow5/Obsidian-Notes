- file URI scheme
	- getting files from your own computer (your own home network)
	- if "host" is omitted, it is taken to be "localhost""(your own computer)
		- even without host, you still need to keep the slash
	- `file:///path`
	- problem: this only allows us to read files off our own computer
	- solution: `http://`
- server vs websever
	- server - the hardware the remote machine is hosted on
	- web server - the software that is used to send the webpages stored on the server to the users that requested it
		- we are using nodeJS

- websites are static information
	- don't change much
	- e.g. restaurant menu 
- web apps are dynamic and content is different for every user
