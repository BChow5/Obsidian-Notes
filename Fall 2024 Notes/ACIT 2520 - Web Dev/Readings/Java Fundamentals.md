### Paths
- paths specify a unique location in the file system
- expressed as a hierarchy of directories separated by a delimiting character 
* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Absolute Path</mark>
	* points to the same location in the file system regardless of the working directory
	* always begins with the root directory and works "inward"
	* ![[Pasted image 20240907192518.png]]
* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Relative Path</mark>
	* starts from the current working directory
	* avoids the need to provide the entire path
