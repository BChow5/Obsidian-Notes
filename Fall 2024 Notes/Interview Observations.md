### Kurtis Interview
- says um a lot 
- good to use more real examples for some questions if you have them 

### Carson Interview
- be careful about saying you like to work alone
	- don't want to sound like you're a bad team worker
- if you already explained an example for a question before, might not want to just reiterate unless you're adding new info. try to have a different example if you can
