#### Readers have jobs to do
* when writing instructions, keep the reader's task in mind
* don't focus on the system
	* reader does not care about theoretical explanations
* "how do i complete the specific task?"

#### Study the reader
- What information are they likely to have already? Assume less
- Never overestimate what people know
- What information are they likely to need at the moment they pick up your instructions? 

#### What is a procedure?
- A procedure is a sequence of clearly defined steps that result in the completion of a job task
- The goal of a procedure is to enable users to complete a job task in an error free manner
- Procedures are the most common type of information in a software manual

#### Make it easy for the reader
* make it easy for readers to
	* find the right procedure in the document (task based headings)
	* perform the task correctly the first time (task focused instructions)

#### Writing style for procedures
* task based heading
* numbered steps
* each step begins with a verb in the imperative form
* each step should be a physical action 

```ad-example
title: Example Procedure

```

#### Structure of a procedure
* a procedure should include:
	* a procedure title
	* a brief intro that identifies the real world task purpose and its relevance
		* what are we about to do?
		* why are we doing that?
	* numbered steps
		* how to do it
	* screenshots or visuals as needed

#### Writing task oriented procedures
- Careful task analysis precedes quality finished procedures
	- procedures should identity real world, typical tasks that the users are likely to perform
	- procedures should follow typical scenarios, and include corresponding data and screenshots
- aim to group related tasks into clusters of procedures
