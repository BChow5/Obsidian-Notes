- Router
	- layer 3 device that can make forwarding decisions based on logical addresses (e.g. Ip address)
- Wide Area Network WAN
	- a network connection that interconnects geographically separate networks
- VPN Virtual Private Network
	- allows a secure connection to be setup over an untrusted network 
- Ethernet Switch
	- a layer 2 device that makes forwarding decisions based on a physical addresses (i.e. MAC addresses) 
- Network Interface Card NIC
	- a card inside of a networked device that allows the device to communicate on a network 
- Media Access Control (MAC) Address
	- a 48 bit address burned into an NIC, typically written in hexadecimal  
	- switches build a MAC address table inside of itself 
		- list of port and MAC addresses 
- Intrusion Prevention System IPS
	- a sensor that sits in line with network traffic, can recognize the signature of well known attacks and can stop them 
- Intrusion Detection System IDS
	- a sensor that receives a copy of network traffic, can recognize the signature of well known attacks, and can stop the attacks 
- Firewall
	- device uses a set of rules to determine what traffic to permit or deny between different portions of a network 
- demilitarized zone DMZ
	- the term typically given to a portion of a network that should be accessible by external devices 
- firewall router
	- router configured to perform firewall duties 
- multilayer switch
	- an ethernet switch that can make forwarding decisions based on layer 3 (and higher) information (e.g. IP addresses) like a router, and can also make decision based on layer 2 information like a layer 2 ethernet switch
		- can do things of both a router and a switch 
- cache engine
	- locally stores content retrieved from a remote network and sends that content to local devices requesting that content to save bandwidth 
- network attached storage device NAS device
	- a network appliance that makes storage resources available to network clients
