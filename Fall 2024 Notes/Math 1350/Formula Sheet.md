### Graphs and numerical summaries
- **mean**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240925230652.png]]
	- affected by extreme values (outliers)
- **median**
	-  **Arrange the data in ascending order**: Sort the numbers from smallest to largest.
	- **Identify the number of data points (nnn)**: Determine how many numbers are in the dataset.
	- **Determine if the number of data points is odd or even**:
		- If **odd**, the median is the middle number.
		- If **even**, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
			- if not a whole number, round up
- **standard deviation**
	- - ![[Pasted image 20240920100712.png]]
	- n = sample size
	- N = population size 
	- Xi = the value at the position
	- Xbar = mean of sample
		- mean is the same for everyone one once you've calculated it 
	- mew = mean of population
- **skewness**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240920110229.png]]
		- xbar = mean
		- xtilda = median
		- s = standard deviation 
- **proportions**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240925222957.png]]
	-  x = frequency
	- n = sample or population 
- **variance**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240920104634.png]]
	- specifically, variance in the square of the standard deviation
- **range = max - min**
- **IQR = Q3- Q1**
	- Q1 =  total amount * 25/100 = position
	- Q3 = total amount * 75/100
	- if decimal, round up
	- IQR is not sensitive to extreme values, but it is not using all of the data points 

### Probability and counting 
- **classical approach**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240927101754.png]]
- **relative approach**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240927101858.png]]
- **Fundamental Counting Rule**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240927105257.png]]
- **Permutations**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240927105422.png]]
	- for when order of the item matters and without replacement
- **Combinations**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240927105508.png]]
	- for when order of the item doesn't matter and without replacement
	- the denominator is for removing overcounting 
		- this is because we don't care about the order 
- **choosing 1 from x number of different options** (fundamental counting rule)
	- multiple the number of options of the pools together

**Summary** 
![[Pasted image 20241002204523.png]]
- **Addition rule - Union Probability** 
	- P (A u B) = P(A) + P (B) - P(A and b)
	- if A and B are mutually exclusive then P(A n B) = 0
	- ![[Pasted image 20241004102105.png]]
	- the word "or" means its addition rule
- **Multiplication Rule - Join Probability**
	- if you see the word "and" then it's multiplication rule 
	- P (A n B)
		- P (A | B) x P(B)
	- **P( A n B) = P(A) x P( B | A)**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241010195050.png]]
	- independent events: 
		- P(A|B) = P(A)
		- P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)

- **Complementary Rule**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241010194353.png]]
- **at least one problems**
	- best to use complementary rule

### Standard Deviation
- ![[Pasted image 20241017183406.png]]
- **x = mu + z * sigma**
	- mu = mean
	- sigma = standard deviation
- **empirical rule**
	- 65% of x values are within 1 standard deviation of the mean
	- 95% of x values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean
	- 99.7% of x values are within 3 standard deviations of the mean
- **percentile using z score**
	- e.g. 90th percentile = 0.90 area
		- so we find the corresponding value for 0.9 on the z score table
			- you choose the closer value to 0.9 to get your z score
		- then you calculate x with our other formula
	- e.g. you want 1% = 0.01 area
		- so find the z score closest to 0.01
- **getting values between 2 numbers**
	- when given X:
		- calculate the z scores of the 2 numbers the area is between
		- use the z = (X - mu)/sigma for both 
		- get the areas for Z1 and z2 off of the chart
		- subtract z2 area - z1 area 
- **unusual values**
	- (-2 <= Z <= 2)
	- so then you calculate to find X and see
		- x = mu + z * sigma
	- if it is greater 2 or less than -2, you have an unusual value
- **outliers**
	- IQR = Q3-Q1
		- Q1 = 25th percentile
		- Q3 = 75th percentile 
	- ![[Pasted image 20241017201104.png]]
		- value of Q1 = mu + z(-0.67) * sigma
		- value Q3 = mu + z (0.67) * sigma
	- ![[Pasted image 20241017213523.png]]
		- 
	- > Q3 + 1.5IQR (upper limit of outlier)
	- < Q1 - 1.5IQR (lower limit of outlier)
	-  if you want to calculate the percentage of people above an upper limit, then you can do:
		- **1 - area (value at the z score) = area greater than upper limit**
			- multiply the final answer by 100 if you need that in a percentage answer
