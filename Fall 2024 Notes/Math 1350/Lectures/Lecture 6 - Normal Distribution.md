- P(a <= X <= b) = area under pdf on a<= X <= b
- P(X = c) = 0
	- a single vertical line
	- a line segment has no area
- because it is symmetrical, you can just look for the middle of the graph for the mean (mu)
	- mu (mean) = 164.7
	- sigma (Standard deviation) = 7 
		- we look at the SD labelled on the graph and get the difference 
		- you could look at any of them to get the SD difference
- **X ~ N (164.7, 49)**
	- this is how your write out the normal distribution 
- **Standard Normal Distribution**
	- Z ~ N (0,1)
- **non standard Normal Distribution**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241011095620.png]]
- within 1 SD  in both directions (+ 1 or - 1 of SD) of the average (middle point), there is 68% of individuals of the population fall within the the middle SD
- **empirical rule** 
	- 68%, 95%, 99.7%

### Non-Standard Normal Distributions and 𝑧-scores
- ![[Pasted image 20241011111200.png]]
	- z = (X - mu)/sigma
	- this is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">z score formula </mark>
	- The 𝑧-score indicates how many standard deviations a specific 𝑥 is away from the mean value.

#### example
![[Pasted image 20241011111854.png]]
- z score = (80 - 70)/5 = 2
  z score = 90 - 80)/10 = 1
- so z score of 2 is better for the mark
	- its a better grade relative to how the rest of the class did even though the raw grade number is lower 

#### Example
![[Pasted image 20241011112022.png]]
- x1 = 48000
- x2 = 54000
- z1 = (48000 - 50000)/ 2000 = -1
- z2 = (54000 - 50000)/ 2000 = 2
- so we get the probability of the z score between the 2 x's
	- P(-1 < z < 2)
- looking at the chart to get these values
	- 0.9772 - 0.1587 = 

#### Example - unusual values 
![[Pasted image 20241011112608.png]]
- Z > 2 or Z < -2 is unusual
	- this 2 value is just a given value that we work with for these. its always 2 
- z = (196-278.4) / 7.6 = 2.3
- unusual value is different from outliers

#### Example - outliers
![[Pasted image 20241011113013.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241011113003.png]]
- Q1 = P25 (25th percentile) = -0.67
- Q3 = P75 = 0.67
- IQR = 1.34
	- this is the difference of Q1 and Q3
	- Q3-Q1
- upper limit of outliers is Q3 +1.5IQR = 2.68
- so for 2.3, he is usually tall but not an outlier
