### Sampling Distribution of Xbar
![[Pasted image 20241101100720.png]]
- X of a large population of individuals
- population mean is mu X
- Xbar is a random variable based on our randomly selected sample
- the probability of distribution of Xbar is called the **sampling distribution of Xbar**

### Central Limit Theorem 
- if we collect sample sizes of n from a populatio, calculate the mean of each of those samples and plot those means on a histogram, the histogram will approximate a normal distribution
- if the sample is large enough, the sample distribution taken from any population distribution regardless of its shape will approximate a normal distribution
	- even if the original graph shape isn't normal  

### Symbols
- mu = population mean
- xbar = sample mean
- mu xbar = mean of the sampling distribution 
- sigma = standard deviation of the population
- s = standard deviation of the sample
- sigma xbar = standard deviation of the sampling distribution 
	- standard deviation of many samples 
- n = size of the sample 
  

### Law of Large Numbers
- if we increase n, the xbar will get close to mu as n increases
	- if mu is 36, to get this number, we can take small samples to estimate this value
	- n= 10 xbar = 32
	- n=50 xbar = 38.5
	- n = 100 xbar = 35.3
- as n goes up, the mean of the sample gets closer to the population mean 
- as n goes up, the sampling distribution mean will get close to the population mean

- standard deviation of the sampling distribution = standard deviation of the population divided by n square root

 **when n is large,** we can replace the mean of the sample distribution with the mean of the population

- **When n is large**, we can use this formula for our probability calculations by calculating Z and using Z table 


- as n increases, the standard deviation of the sample mean (sigma xbar)(also called standard error) decreases
	- this means that the data becomes less spread in the sampling distribution and be more narrow

### Sample Proportion
