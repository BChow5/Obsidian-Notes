### Requirements for a Binomial Experiment / random variable / distribution
- if an experiment has exactly 2 outcomes, success and failure, then it is called a Bernoulli trial
	- e.g.
		- heads/tails
		- true/false
		- pass/fail
		- test positive/ test negative 
- if an experiment consists of n independent Bernoulli Trials with success rate p, then it is called a Binomial Experiment 
- The number of successes, 𝑋, is a Binomial Random Variable and it follows a Binomial Distribution, i.e. 𝑋~𝐵𝑖𝑛(𝑛, 𝑝)
	- if we're counting the number of success or fail, then it is a Binomial Random Variable 

#### Characteristics of Binomial Experiment
- a fixed number of trials
	- the total number of trials is a fixed number, n 
- independent trials
	- the outcome of any one trial does not affect the outcome of the other trials
- Bernoulli trials
	- each trial results in one of the two possible outcomes, "success" (with probability p) or "failure" (with probability 1 = 1 -p)
