- 7 questions
- only first question is on probability
	- conditional probability 
	- .e.g. sunny or rainy question with the tree diagram 
	- e.g. unit 5 practice questions: covid or fire alarm using 2 way table 
	- need to show if two events are independent or not 
	- or if they are mutually exclusive or not 
- Binomial Distribution (unit 7)
	- need to know if question is talking about binomial distribution
		- conditions/requirements (3-4 of them)
			- fixed number of trials
			- every trial is Bernoulli (only 2 outcomes)
			- trials need to be independent and identical 
	- probability  P(X=x): nCx * p^x * (1-p)^n-x
	- expected outcome: np
	- variance: np(1-p)
- Sampling Distribution 
	- xbar (about sample)
		- check if its normal
			- n >= 30 or x is normally distributed 
	- phat (about sample)
		- np >=5 and nq >= 5
- next 4 are about hypothesis testing 
	- they all follow approx the same steps
- Q4 - Unit 9
	- careful on step 1
	- step 2: z stat or t stat
- Q5 - Unit 10 
	- careful on step 1
	- step 2: z stat or t stat
- Q6 - Unit 11 
	- always same h0
	- h1 just say otherwise 
- Q7 - Unit 12
	- always same h0 (independent)
	- h1 dependent
