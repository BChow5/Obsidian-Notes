### Discussion 
- what does it mean to "value individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
	- working towards people's strengths and collaborative efforts rather than focusing on what tools you're using.  
- what does it mean to value "working software over comprehensive documentation?"
	- you would rather complete a piece of working software rather than causing too many delays by documentation that would slow down the process 
- what does it mean to value "customer collaboration over contract negotiation" 
	- customer input is valuable and the project scope can always change once they see what you have. so their feedback is more useful than purely following what was written on a contract before the project began 
- what does it mean to value "responding to change over following a plan"
	- agile is about adaptable to changes in the project scope. the final goal is customer satisfaction so we can change and respond to get them better satisfaction 

### Project Critical Path
- constrain cost and schedule
	- only scope will change

### Project schedule - waterfall
- sequence activities
	- identifying dependencies between the project activities
- task dependency 
	- one task controls the timing of another task
- project network diagram 
	- shows logical task (inter)dependencies 

### general methods to "accelerate" project completion
- fast tracking
	- no extra cost
	- overlapping the tasks on critical path
- crashing
	- resources not contrained
	- pay additional money to shorted the schedule 

### Discussion 2
- is there a critical path in an iterative (scrum) project
	- yes there is still a critical path in iterative projects
- does the iron triangle apply to projects
	- not really, because some 
- how do you reduce duration in iterative projects?
	- change scope
- what happens at the end of  the
