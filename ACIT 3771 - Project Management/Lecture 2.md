### Agile Manifesto
- we value items on the right but we value more the items on the left
- traditional methods put a lot of emphasis of things on the right 

| individuals and interactions | processes and tools         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| working software             | comprehensive documentation |
| customer collaboration       | contract negotiation        |
| responding to change         | following a plan            |

### Agile Principles
1. our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. welcome changing requirements, even late in the development. agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage 
3. deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale 
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.  
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.  
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.  
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility\  
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. 
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.  
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

- the cost of change increases overtime as the project progresses 
- we try to avoid this cost by having all of our planning and analysis up front 
- expertise is costly but they can do the job well 
	- cost doesn't really go up over time
- our level of expertise can be poor if we've never applied this tech to types of customers at that time
	- our technology changes so quickly in our industry
	- tech can change over the span of a project

### Relative estimation
- step 1
	- identify users (acotrs) and define a bunch of User Stories for them
- step 2
	- identify your "baseline"
	- this is generally the smallest bit of functionality
- step 3
	- do planning poker for each user story
	- story points
