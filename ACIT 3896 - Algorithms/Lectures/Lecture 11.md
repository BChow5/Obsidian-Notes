- selection sort - O(n^2)
	- finds the smallest value
	- puts it at the front of the "zone of chaos" then adds that to "zone of order"
	- repeat and continually grow the "zone of order"
- insertion sort - O(n^2)
	- pick a random number
	- check if its larger than the largest thing in the "zone of order"
		- if so, then put it at the top
	- if not, check if its bigger than the next one
	- like sorting cards in your hands into the right order
