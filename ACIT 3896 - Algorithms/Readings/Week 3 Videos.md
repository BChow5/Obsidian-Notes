### Video 1: Functions
- this is about mathematical functions

#### Types of Functions
- Linear
	- e.g. y = ax + b
- Polynomials
	- y = __ + __ + __
	- can have any number of terms
	- e.g. the u-shaped graphs 
	- **Degree**: The highest power of the variable (nnn) in the function determines its degree.
- exponential
	- y = a * b<sup>x</sup>
	- position of the x matters to determine if this is an exponential function
		- it needs to be an exponent to be exponential
- logarithmic 
	- y = alog<sub>b</sub>(x)+c
		- cannot add in an exponent

### Video 2: Interpolation and Extrapolation Background
#### interpolation
- sometimes we can make educated guesses about the data points that are between data points that we already know
- sometimes it is as simple as a straight line
- sometimes it isn't as simple as a straight line
	- e.g. not constant speeds 
	- sometimes it's other curve we might know
		- like a polynomial
		- or maybe exponential
- with more data points, we can rule out some bad guesses
	- gives us better change of making the correct guess 
- correctly interpolating real life data  requires critical thinking and problem solving. maybe a bit of luck
- fewest data points you have, the more luck you need
	- the more data, less luck needed 

#### Extrapolation
- inter: between data points
- extra: beyond/outside of existing data
- so extrapolation is trying to guess data outside of our data points 
- critical thinking for both interpolation and extrapolation
	- but especially for extrapolation 
- math technique cannot stop you from making silly assumptions
- if you have noisy measurements (measurement error) and you instead assume all your data is perfect, you're going to have trouble 

### Video 2: Interpolation and Extrapolation with Spreadsheets
- linear data looks linear
- exponential data looks linear if the Y-axis is logarithmic (log scale) 
- logarithmic looks linear if we make the X-axis is logarithmic (log scale) 
- polynomial looks linear if we make BOTH x and y axis is logarithmic (log scale)
