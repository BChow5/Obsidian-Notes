### Data Structures
- things like lists, dictionaries, tuples are called data structures
- data structure isn't just structure of the data
	- there are internal relationships
- e.g. lists
	- there is an order to the data in the list
- cheap to add things to the end of a list
- dictionaries cost more for some basics
	- but unlike lists, you can add or remove cheaply from the beginning to end
- pros and cons for each data structure
