### Big oh log
- len is constant time
- is for a list is constant time
- if is constant time
- how many recursive calls does it make?
	- O(log n)
	- from recursive cutting in half
- logs
	- often just cutting lists in half over and over
	-  

### mergesort 
- divide and conquer 
- merge(left,right)
	- takes 2 parameters of sorted lists
		- these can be any numbers as long as they are sorted within their own list
	- combines them together sorted 
	- don't have to be the same size lists 
	-
