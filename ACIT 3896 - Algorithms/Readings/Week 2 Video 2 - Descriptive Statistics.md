- mean is not necessarily the same as average
	- use the term mean
- averages are useful to summarize
	- including the mean
	- but the mean may not always be enough 

#### some ideas why the mean might be bad
- tight clustering vs loose clustering
	- aka more equal distribution vs uneven distribution 
		- sometimes we care
	- tight clusters always nice and tidy
	- loose clusters, sometimes its a problem
- sometimes it leans more to one side than the other
	- e.g. when calculating mean income of people, a small number of rich people will stretch distribution 
- sometimes there are two humps, two "pseudo modes"
	- or more than 2
	- "bimodal", "multi-modal" 
- e.g. the mean human has approximately 1 ovary
	- this is a useless statistic
- sometimes there are outliers that matter
	- need to notice the outliers so we can do critical thinking 
- sometimes there are outliers that can be worked around
	- e.g. children's seatbelts are a outlier we work around 

#### So now what?
- the median is not the same as the mean
- median is the middle point in the distribution
- standard deviation
	- normal distribution 
- quantiles
	- many variations 
		- median
			- boundary between the small half and the large half
		- quartiles: 4
		- deciles: 10
		- percentiles: 100 
			- 1st percentile: larger than 1% (but smaller than 99%)
			- 99th percentile: smaller than 1% (but larger than 99%)
	- sort the data, divide the data up into equal buckets (by the sorting), find the boundaries
	- quartiles
		- 1st quartile is not the same as the first quarter
			- it is a single value that is on the boundary of the 1st quarter
		- 2nd quartile is the median 

#### Maybe try visualizing
- e.g. Anscombe quartet 
- some important insights will only come from visualizing
	- e.g. can have same median or mean but look very different 
- no simple one size sits all for how to visualize 
	- scatter plots can be a good start
